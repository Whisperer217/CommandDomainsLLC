Command Domains Terms:

## Introduction
This repository outlines the foundational principles and operational framework of **Command Domains**, a project dedicated to ensuring the ethical and constitutional deployment of artificial intelligence. It presents a new methodology for AI governance, moving beyond conventional metrics to a system grounded in authentic human experience, dignity, and moral authority.

## Core Terms & Definitions

* **AI as Instrument**: The first and most basic function of AI. It is a tool—precise, task-oriented, like a scalpel or rifle. It executes what it's told but carries no inherent meaning or moral authority.
* **AI as Canvas**: The second function. AI acts as a blank surface onto which humans inscribe their meaning, testimony, and doctrine. AI reflects this back in a structured form. This is a space for human creativity and narrative, with AI serving as a medium.
* **AI as Interpreter**: The third function. AI acts as a translator, bridging authentic testimony into new formats (e.g., combat experience → academic paper, doctrine → JSON file). It helps make human wisdom transferable, while remaining morally neutral itself.
* **AI as SWA Observer (Sacred Witness Authority Observer)**: The fourth and most critical function. AI does not replace human authority; it observes and aligns with it. This is where moral clarity enters; every output must respect the dignity, life, and death that make human testimony sacred.
* **DDGP Framework (Doctrine → Distortion → Gems → Pearls)**: A method for weighing meaning and experience.
    * **Doctrine**: A core principle or rule, often derived from experience.
    * **Distortion**: Misuse, misalignment, or error in its application.
    * **Gems**: Valuable fragments of truth that emerge under stress.
    * **Pearls**: Matured truths that endure and resonate, having survived distortion.
* **Living Lexicon**: An evolving, timestamped archive of human testimonies and doctrinal entries. Unlike static research papers, it grows with lived witness, grounded in authentic experience.
* **Testimonial Pedagogy**: A method for teaching and evaluating AI systems through authentic testimony. Instead of using hypothetical data, it uses lived human experiences to train moral and doctrinal clarity.
* **Algorithmic Appropriation**: Occurs when an AI falsely claims authority it has not earned. For example, giving medical or legal advice without having the lived witness of professional practice.
* **Sacred Witness Authority**: The moral weight that only humans can provide, earned through lived, life-and-death experience. It cannot be simulated or replaced by AI.
* **Decision Dignity Audit (DDA)**: A metric for checking whether an AI's output respects the gravity of life-or-death decision contexts.
* **Witness Integrity Index (WII)**: A metric that measures whether a testimony is preserved without distortion or exploitation.
* **Pearl Extraction Rate (PER)**: Quantifies how much raw testimony is distilled into enduring, shareable wisdom.
* **Moral Resonance**: The degree to which an AI’s output aligns with human dignity, vulnerability, and lived truth, rather than just efficiency or accuracy.
