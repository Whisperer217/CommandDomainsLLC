Command Domains: Logos Doctrine AI
Mission
If AI is to accompany us—to battlefields, clinics, or Mars—it must learn to bear witness with dignity. Command Domains ensures that testimony becomes doctrine, so that machines remember us completely.
Vision
Command Domains builds a framework where combat witness, testimony, and lived doctrine shape the moral compass of AI systems. Rather than measuring only speed, accuracy, or cost, we evaluate AI outputs against the Doctrine → Distortion → Gems → Pearls (DDGP) model to ensure they resonate with life-and-death moral clarity.
Core Components
1. Codex Archive

Timestamped doctrinal entries following the DDGP framework
Witness-driven insights from combat medicine and lived trauma
Citable repository of authentic testimonial data

2. Testimonial Pedagogy Metrics

Testimonial Weight Score (TWS): Honors the moral gravity of AI advice
Doctrine Alignment Ratio (DAR): Maps outputs to DDGP framework
Witness Integrity Index (WII): Preserves dignity in personal testimony
Pearl Extraction Rate (PER): Elevates testimony into resonant meaning
Decision Dignity Audit (DDA): Respects life/death analogs in AI recommendations
Distortion Sensitivity Score (DSS): Flags uncertainty vs. false confidence

3. Deployment

Open documentation of Codex entries and framework methodology
Evaluation rubrics for AI labs, defense contractors, and healthcare organizations
Software tools (in development) to test AI outputs against testimonial metrics
