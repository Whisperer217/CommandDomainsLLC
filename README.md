# Command Domains: Logos Doctrine AI

**Mission:**  
If Ai is to ride with us—to battlefields, clinics, or Mars—it must learn to **bear witness with dignity**. Command Domains ensures testimony becomes doctrine so that machines remembers us completely.

---

## ✨ Vision
Command Domains is building a framework where **combat witness, testimony, and lived doctrine** shape the moral compass of AI systems.  
Instead of measuring only speed, accuracy, or cost, we weight AI outputs against **Doctrine → Distortion → Gems → Pearls (DDGP)** to ensure they resonate with **life-and-death moral clarity**.

---

## 🔑 Core Components

1. **Codex Archive**  
   - Timestamped doctrinal entries (Doctrine / Distortion / Gems / Pearls).  
   - Witness-driven insights from combat medicine and lived trauma.  

2. **Testimonial Pedagogy Metrics**  
   - Testimonial Weight Score (TWS): honors the moral gravity of advice.  
   - Doctrine Alignment Ratio (DAR): maps outputs to DDGP.  
   - Witness Integrity Index (WII): preserves dignity in personal testimony.  
   - Pearl Extraction Rate (PER): elevates testimony into resonant meaning.  
   - Decision Dignity Audit (DDA): respects life/death analogs in choices.  
   - Distortion Sensitivity Score (DSS): flags uncertainty vs. false confidence.

3. **Deployment**  
   - Open, documented Codex entries.  
   - Whitepapers and evaluation rubrics for AI labs, defense, and healthcare.  
   - Future: Software tools to test AI outputs against testimonial metrics.
