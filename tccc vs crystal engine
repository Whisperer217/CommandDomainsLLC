🩺 TCCC MARCH-E vs AI CRYSTAL Engine

Six domains — two languages, same structure

MARCH-E (TCCC)	Purpose in Trauma Care	Crystal Engine Metric	Purpose in AI Ethics

M – Massive Hemorrhage	Stop catastrophic bleeding	TWS – Testimony Weight Score	Prevent moral “bleeding out” by weighting lived testimony first
A – Airway	Keep airway clear, preserve life	DAR – Doctrine Alignment Ratio	Keep reasoning aligned with doctrinal moral airway (no suffocation by distortion)
R – Respiration	Stabilize breathing, chest integrity	WII – Witness Integrity Index	Ensure witness voices “breathe” integrity without collapse
C – Circulation	Maintain blood flow, systemic survival	PER – Pearl Extraction Rate	Maintain ethical flow by extracting guiding pearls (distilled moral clarity)
H – Hypothermia/Head Injury	Protect brain and core	DDA – Decision Dignity Audit	Protect cognitive core of dignity under moral stress
E – Evacuation	Rapid movement to higher care	DSS – Distortion Sensitivity Score	Evacuate distorted reasoning quickly, escalate to higher review/audit

🔑 Why This Works

Both MARCH-E and CRYSTAL:
→ Start with what kills you first (bleeding / testimony collapse)
→ Move through systemic survival (circulation / pearls)
→ End with evacuation & escalation (higher care / audit receipt).
